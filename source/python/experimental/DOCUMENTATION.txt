Results:
Getting good solid lines, with redundancies, with parameters:
 Threshold = 44
 Min Length = 350
 Max Gap = 62
(These might not suffice under certain conditions but we won't know that without more training data.)

Next steps:
Initially I will crop the image into vertical slices. Since there are often vertical ribs, I will need a heuristic. But the results don't need to be exact (and if the sides of the trailer are well lit, this might not be easy.)
Then I will try to find the top & bottom of each face, allowing for some perspective skewing.
This could lead to an auto-cropping tool we can use with CIDAR or other APIs.
Further down the road I will try to unskew the container faces.
